Aribe Website wrapper API
=========================


This is a wrapper around the Ariba web shop's supplier
portal that provides an API to perform some
actions in an automised way.

This API is intended to be used with web automation
tools to automate the seller's workflow.

-------------

You need an Ariba seller account, which is hard to get. SAP seems to
provide such accounts only to suppliers that are requested by
SAP customers. They are eager to build a web of trust to avoid
untrustworthy sellers on the Ariba market place.
